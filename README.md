🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (index.html)
        |
        ▼
AWS API Gateway  ←→  AWS Lambda (Python)
        |
        ▼
    AWS S3 Bucket
```

* Frontend: HTML/CSS/JS (no dependencies)
* Backend: Python (boto3 for AWS)
* Authentication: AWS Secrets Manager (Basic Auth)

---

 🔧 Backend Setup (Lambda)

1. Create an S3 bucket
   Example:

   ```
   credit-websites-hosting
   ```

2. Create a Secret in AWS Secrets Manager (name: `tests`)
   Example JSON:

   ```json
   {
     "admin": { "password": "Admin@123", "root_folder": "" },
     "user1": { "password": "User@123", "root_folder": "" }
   }
   ```

3. Deploy the Python backend (Lambda):

   ```python
   import boto3, base64, json, io, zipfile
   # ... (use the backend code provided in this repo)
   ```

4. Create an API Gateway with routes:

   ```
   /list          (GET)
   /list-files    (GET)
   /put           (PUT)
   /get           (GET)
   /delete        (DELETE)
   /download-folder (GET)
   /delete-folder (DELETE)
   ```

5. Enable CORS on all endpoints.

 🖥️ Frontend Setup

1. Open `index.html`
2. Update your API Gateway endpoint:

   ```js
   const apiBase = "https://your-api-id.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod";
   ```
3. Open the file in your browser.
4. Login using credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

 🧰 Example Credentials

| Username | Password  |
| -------- | --------- |
| admin    | Admin@123 |
| user1    | User@123  |

---

 🧪 Example Workflow

1. Login with your credentials
2. Upload files to S3
3. List & Download available files
4. Delete unwanted files
5. Create Folders inside your bucket
